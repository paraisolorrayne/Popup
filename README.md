# Popup

Simple example for the presentation popup in the view controller, based on the UIPopoverPresentationController class:
The UIPopoverPresentationController object manages the display of content in a popover. From the time a popover is presented until the time it is dismissed, UIKit uses an instance of this class to manage the presentation behavior. You use instances of this class as-is to configure aspects of the popover appearance and behavior for view controllers whose presentation style is set to UIModalPresentationPopover.
